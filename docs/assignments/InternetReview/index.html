    <h1> Week 1: Internet Review</h1>
    <p>The web can be a great place to explore, learn, laugh, and enjoy the information and endless amounts of media. But it can also be a scary place filled with fake news and false information.</p>
    <p> My personal experience on the web has shaped my views on it by the way I have used it in the past decade. I started using the web when I was around seven or eight years old to play Cartoon Network games and other games that were promoted on television. </P>
    <p> Those games were very memorable and helped the time pass. The web is filled with many interactions, whether it be games, music, videos, or text.</p>
    <p> The web just has many ways to function as research and gather information to learn things that they do not know. The web can be so useful but be so harmful to many people.</p>
    <p> The media is filled with many lies and stigma towards many things. There’s so much gray area with the web yet the web can be so expansive. Many things people believe on the internet when they are not backed up by a source.</p>
    <p>The media can favor many things and show people sides to a story without any evidence or logical reasons. The media can also manipulate how things are interpreted.</p>
    <p>Fake news is real and common towards how information is delivered to an audience. That’s why the web can be a dangerous place. People have odd websites that can be harmful for younger users and can also scam people. </p>
    <p>Many games have ads in the background of the website that would scam users for security information or hackers would take away accounts. The web can have good qualities but also bad ones that we cannot control but we can take precautions.  Score: 8</p>
